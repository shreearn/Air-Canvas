# Air Canvas
Air Canvas is a fun and innovative project that transforms your webcam into a virtual drawing tool. Using hand gestures, you can draw in the air, creating digital art without needing a physical canvas. The application tracks your hand movements in real-time, translating them into colorful drawings on a virtual canvas.

- Choose from a variety of colours like Red, Green, Yellow, Blue to create vibrant drawings.
- Clear the canvas with a simple gesture for a fresh start.
- Real-time tracking ensures a seamless and responsive drawing experience.

Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for the application logic.
- OpenCV: Computer vision library for processing webcam input and hand tracking.
- Mediapipe: Framework for machine learning solutions like hand tracking.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computations.

Instructions on how to use

1. Install the required libraries (OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, Streamlit).

2. Run the application.

3. Welcome to Air Canvas, where you can use your hand gestures to draw on a virtual canvas! If you want to move your hand without drawing, simply bring your forefinger and thumb closer together to pause. To select a color, move your hand into the color box with your forefinger extended. Your hand should be visible on the screen to detect your gestures.
