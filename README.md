Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the application logic.
OpenCV: Computer vision library for processing webcam input and hand tracking.
Mediapipe: Framework for machine learning solutions like hand tracking.
NumPy: Library for numerical computations.

How to Use
Install the required libraries (OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, Streamlit).
Run the application.
Welcome to Air Canvas, where you can use your hand gestures to draw on a virtual canvas! If you want to move your hand without drawing, simply bring your forefinger and thumb closer together to pause. To select a color, move your hand into the color box with your forefinger extended. Your hand should be visible on the screen to detect your gestures.
Have fun creating digital art in a unique and interactive way!
